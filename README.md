# VGifing
Some stupid exploration of using GIFs for VJing. The title of the project has no implication on how people should prononce GIF, one would know better! 

### How to
  * Just add more GIFs in the data folder following the correct naming (gif_####.gif).
  * Pressing space bar randomize the gif (and its position within boundaries)
  * Using TouchOsc app with the provided by default "simple layout" will allow you to trigger the first 16 loaded gifs through the second tab of the layout
  * ???
  * Profit
